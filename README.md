# Credit Growth and Acceleration as Predictors of Banking Crises

This repository contains the data, code, figures, and final report for an empirical study on the role of **credit growth** and **credit acceleration** as early warning indicators of **systemic banking crises**.

The analysis follows a macroprudential *early warning* framework widely used in the literature and by international financial institutions.

## 📄 Study Overview

**Title:**  
*Credit Growth and Acceleration as Predictors of Systemic Banking Crises*

The study examines whether:
- **Credit growth (Δ Credit)** and  
- **Credit acceleration (Δ² Credit, second difference)**  

significantly increase the probability of systemic banking crises.

The empirical strategy combines panel data econometrics with predictive performance evaluation, drawing on international macro-financial databases.

## 🎯 Research Objective

To evaluate whether credit growth and, in particular, credit acceleration provide statistically and economically meaningful signals of impending banking crises using:

- Logit and Probit models  
- Fixed and Random Effects specifications  
- Out-of-sample predictive evaluation via ROC curves  

---

## 🧠 Main Findings (Executive Summary)

### ✔ Key Results
- Both **credit growth** and **credit acceleration** are statistically significant predictors of banking crises.
- **Credit acceleration** is a **more informative early warning indicator** than simple credit growth.
- The preferred specification achieves an **AUROC = 0.81**, indicating strong discriminatory power.
- Average marginal effects indicate that:
  - +1 p.p. in credit growth → **+0.025 p.p.** increase in crisis probability
  - +1 p.p. in credit acceleration → **−0.057 p.p.** change in crisis probability

### ✔ Robustness
- Results are robust to alternative lags (t−1, t−2).
- Consistent across Logit, Probit, Fixed Effects, and Random Effects models.
- Hausman tests favor Random Effects specifications in the baseline sample.

## 📊 Data Sources

The analysis combines multiple international datasets:

- **BIS Credit Statistics**
- **IMF Global Macro Database**
- **World Bank (WDI)**
- **Systemic Banking Crises Database**  
  Laeven & Valencia (2020)

The final dataset is a balanced/unbalanced country-year panel covering advanced and emerging economies.
